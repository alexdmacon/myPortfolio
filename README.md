# My Portfolio

## Description
Using HTML and CSS, I created a portfolio to showcase my work as a web developer and to practice skills including flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. I have some more work to do. But this project should demonstrate:
- A responsive layout made using flexbox.
- Media queries that make the page more readable for users on phones and smaller devices.
- Basically competent HTML and CSS.
- The use of CSS variables.
- The ability to link to other projects.
- Appropriate hyperlinks in the nav bar and in the section highlighting my work.
- The ability to briefly (not briefly enough) describe myself, my experience, and my skills to prospective employers.
